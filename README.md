# SlidingPuzzle
I created an interactive website to explain how the A* and IDA* algorithms can be applied to solve the 15-puzzle. The 15-puzzle is a sliding puzzle that consists of 15 numbered square tiles in random order in a 4 by 4 frame. The goal is to re-arrange the tiles into their correct orders.
